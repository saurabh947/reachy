"""Pytest configuration for the reachy-emotion test suite.

Stubs out the neural-backbone subpackage of emotion_detection_action
(emotion_detection_action.models.*) that is not included in the lightweight
unit-test install.  The full models package pulls in PyTorch, torchvision,
MediaPipe, and other heavy deps that are not needed for testing action handling
or conversation logic.

This conftest is loaded automatically by pytest before any test file is
collected, so the stubs are in place before anything imports emotion_detection_action.
